1- first we go into de file where we want to initialize a new git: cd file.htlm 
2- Initialize a new Git repo here in the current directory.
we do this with = git init
3- Add the file chapter1.txt to the staging area for committing.
git add chapter1.txt
4- Finally, commit the staged file, with a message of "Add chapter 1". Rather than letting Git launch an editor, 
specify your commit message on the command line: use the -m command line option, and specify your message between "quotation marks".
git commit -m " Add chapter 1"
